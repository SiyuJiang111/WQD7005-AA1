## Case Study Overview
In this case study, a dataset related to e-commerce customer behaviour is collected from 2 datasets Online_Sales.csv and CustomerData.xlsx from Kaggle. The dataset will be used to train models like decision tree, boosting and bagging model in predicting the total spent by each customer in 2019.

## Objectives
Customer value is the total value that a customer contributes to the company in the whole life cycle of its interaction with the company. Customer value is usually related to the number of purchases a customer makes, the purchase amount, tenure months, etc. And it is a common practice to assess the value of a customer by the amount he spends in a year. 

Based on this business metric, the main objective is to analyze the total spent by each customer in 2019, which is divided into 3 tasks: 
-	To calculate total spent by each customer in 2019, and bin the data into different categories based on the distribution of total spent range in 1468 customers.
-	Build classification model of customersâ€™ total spent range.
-	Evaluate the result and compare the performance of different algorithms.
