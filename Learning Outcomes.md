In this case study, I made full use of Talend Data Preparation, Talend Data Integration, and SAS Enterprise Miner software to help me simplify my workflow and quickly complete data processing and data analysis. Talend Data Integration is very powerful. It can not only quickly integrate data sets, but also calculate new data based on existing data through various operations and add it to new data sets. SAS Enterprise Miner is a powerful platform composed of various utilities and tools that allows me to perform data preprocessing, data analysis, data modeling, model performance evaluation, etc. in one platform without having to enter any code. It's also very user-friendly for people without computer backgrounds.

During this process I mainly encountered the following challenges:
1. Finding and selecting data sets is very difficult, because few data sets can fully meet the requirements for data variables in case analysis and have sufficient data volume to support a complete analysis.
2. I was not familiar with the operation of the above software and tools at first, so it took me some time to learn and become proficient.
3. The data set lacks target variables that can be classified.

To address these challenges, I took the following steps:
1. Find datasets on public websites and merge datasets that contain useful information.
2. Read the e-book guide and seek help using the software in the online community.
3. I divided the continuous variable total spent into three categories according to the range, and finally successfully performed classification prediction.
